				Biography
			</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Christopher Welborn, I am a 30 year old programmer from Jasper, Al. 
				I have been working with computers and code since childhood. I started out with Q-BASIC 
				in <a href="http://www.windows.com" target="_blank" title="Windows.com">Windows</a> 3.1 and have 
				progressed significantly over the years as the technology has also progressed. I lean towards 
				Windows environments because that is where I have most of my experience, but that is slowly 
				changing as I dive deeper into the 
				<a href="http://www.linux.org" target="_blank" title="Linux.org">Linux</a> operating system.. 
				I currently program in a few different languages but when it comes to Windows I prefer 
				<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/" target="_blank" title="Microsoft.com - Visual Basic">
					Visual Basic .Net
				</a> because that is the language I know best. In the past decade or more I have watched as the 
				BASIC language changed forms and updated itself many times, I have used VB versions 3.0 to 6.0 
				and now .Net. Being a programmer, one language is never enough for me, it helps to have knowledge 
				in other areas such as HTML, JavaScript, Digital Graphics, Hardware, etc. so I dabble in those and 
				other areas as well. Linux is an operating system that I have also been fascinated with ever since 
				I heard about it in 1995. I having been using one or more Linux distributions for the past couple 
				years, and currently use <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" target="_blank" title="Ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> 
				and <a href="http://www.LinuxMint.com" target="_blank" title="LinuxMint.com">Linux Mint</a> to do 
				my hardcore computing. After discovering Linux it was only a matter of time before I started 
				developing applications for the Linux Desktop, and found 
				<a href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank" title="Python.org">Python</a> to be a perfect 
				fit for me. Python is a cross-platform language and is very easy to learn, especially if you have 
				previous programming experience. Using Python also allows me to write applications that can possibly 
				be ported between Linux and Windows, and write tools for the command-line or a GUI in both platforms.
				 I am excited to see what the future holds for me, as I am currently broadening my understanding even 
				 further with the <strong>C</strong> language, microcontrollers such as the ATTiny and the 
				 <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> board, plus my <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi's</a>. 
				 I will continue to study and learn new languages/concepts. I will always try to write code that benefits 
				 me and others.

			<p>
				I mostly write tools that make my everyday tasks quicker or easier, but like many coders I sometimes 
				write code just to learn from it and teach myself new concepts. Some projects I use on a daily basis, 
				and others never see the light of day. I plan on uploading some of my projects to this site in the 
				hope that they might help other programmers and normal users from every skill level to accomplish 
				their tasks, or to learn from the code I publish. I currently have a regular day job so this won't 
				happen over night, but I will continue to work on my projects and update this site as needed.
