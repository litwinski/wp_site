	<!-- Description -->
	<p>
		Linux command-line tool that opens files with your favorite editor,
		but also automatically uses your favorite sudo command when needed for write-permissions.
		This way, you won't forget to open with sudo and get that annoying "no-permissions" or
		"cannot save" message.
	</p>
	<p>
		If root-permissions are required for write-access, your elevation command will ask you
		for the password. If they are not required, your editor command will be used alone.
		This is because opening all files as root may put root ownership/group status on files
		that don't really need it, which is also annoying.

<!-- Usage -->
<div class='wp-block feature-list'>
	<div class='title-box'>
		<h3 class='title'>Usage</h3>
	</div>

	<pre class='bash'>
cedit <filename>
# ...to open a file.
	
cedit list
# ...lists current configuration (editor and elevation command)
		
cedit set editor=[your editor]
cedit set elevcmd=[your elevation-cmd]
# ...sets your favorite commands so cedit will remember what to use.
	</pre>

	<p>
		If your favorite editor isn't in the same directory as cedit or /usr/bin, then
		you will need to set the editor like this:
		<pre class='bash'>
cedit set editor=/my/path/to/myeditor
		</pre>
	</p>
</div>

<!-- Installation -->
<div class='wp-block feature-list'>
	<div class='title-box'>
		<h3 class='title'>Installation</h3>
	</div>
	<p>
		You can create a symlink to the cedit.py script yourself, or you can use the builtin 'install' command.
	</p>
	<p>
		To install cedit in /usr/bin (for all users) run:
    </p>
    <pre class='bash'>
sudo ./cedit.py install
	</pre>
	
	<p>
		To install cedit for a single user run:
   	</p>
   	<pre class='bash'>
./cedit.py install user
    
# this will try to install cedit to /home/USERNAME/.local/bin
# you will need this directory to exist, and be included in your PATH variable.
	</pre>
	<p>
		If everything went well, or you manually created the symlink yourself, you should be able to run
		cedit like this from anywhere:
    </p>
    <pre class='bash'>
cedit <filename>
# with no .py extension or ./ prefix...
	</pre>
</div>

<!-- With no settings -->
<div class='wp-block feature-list'>
	<div class='title-box'>
		<h3 class='title'>With no settings</h3>
	</div>
	<p>
		If no settings are set, cedit will try to look for a few 'popular' commands to
		work with. 
	</p>
	<p>
		cedit will look for these editors if your favorite isn't set:
	</p>
	<ul class='circle-small'>
		<li>kate</li>
		<li>gedit</li>
		<li>leafpad</li>
		<li>kwrite</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		cedit will look for these elevation commands if your favorite isn't set:
	</p>
	<ul class='circle-small'>
		<li>kdesudo</li>
		<li>gksudo</li>
		<li>sudo</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Without any settings, if you have both <span class='B'>kate</span> and 
		<span class='B'>kdesudo</span> installed, cedit will
		open your 'root-permissions' file by running: 
		<span class='highlight-embedded bash'>kdesudo kate <filename></span>
		If the file doesn't require root permissions then just: 
		<span class='highlight-embedded bash'>kate <filename></span>
	</p>
</div>

<!-- Future -->
<div class='wp-block feature-list'>
	<div class='title-box'>
		<h3 class='title'>Future</h3>
	</div>
	<p>
		There may be plans to allow different editors to be chosen for different file-types.
		Right now cedit works as expected, as long as you only use one editor most often.
		I may add the ability to set favorite editors for favorite file-types like:
	</p>
	<pre class='bash'>
cedit set .py=geany
	</pre>
</div>
