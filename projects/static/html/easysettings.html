	<p>	
		Now supports Python 3.3! The major difference was in the <strong>pickle</strong> library.
		<strong>Pickle</strong> used strings in python 2.7, and bytes in python 3. All pickled objects
		are now using a string format in EasySettings, with the help of 3 little conversion
		functions. You will never have to use these functions, they're really internal use
		only. But if you want to see how to return a string from <code>pickle.dumps()</code> in python 3,
		look at the <code>safe_pickle_str()</code> function. To load from a string, instead of bytes, in
		python 3's <code>pickle.loads()</code>, look at <code>safe_pickle_obj()</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The non-string saving method has been enhanced so debug printing will be
		'prettier'. Example of 'debug printing' settings:
	</p>
	<pre class='python'>
from easysettings import easysettings
settings = easysettings.easysettings('myconfigfile.conf')
settings.set('option', True)
settings.set('option2', ['cjw', 'amy', 'joseph'])
print settings
# this will now print as:
# 	{'option': True, 'option2', ['cjw', 'amy', 'joseph']}
# instead of pickle's messed up looking strings like:
#	{'option': I01\n.  (for a True boolean value), ... }
	</pre>
	
	<p>
		This fix also allows you to save values with the newline character in them. So code like
		this will work:
	</p>
	<pre class='python'>
settings.set('mytext', 'this\nstring\n\has\nnewlines.')
print settings.get('mytext')
# this will result in:
# 	this
#	string
#	has
#	newlines.
	</pre>

		Basic Usage
	</h2>

	<pre class='python'>
#!/usr/bin/env python
# --------------- Creation ----------------
	
from easysettings import easysettings

settings = easysettings.easysettings("myconfigfile.conf")

# configfile_exists() checks for existing config, and creates one if needed.
# ** this function is called automatically now when a filename is passed to easysettings. **
# if you wish to disable it, just do: settings = easysettings.easysettings() and set
# settings.configfile later.

# ------------- Basic Functions -----------
# set without saving
settings.set("username", "cjw")
settings.set("firstrun", False)
	
print settings.get("username")
# this results in "cjw"

# check if file is saved
if not settings.is_saved():
	print "you haven't saved the settings to disk yet."

# ...settings are still available even if they haven't
#    been saved to disk

# save
settings.save()

# you may also set & save in one line...

		Features
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Easy Settings has the basic features you would expect out of a settings module,
		and it's very easy to use. If your project needs to save simple settings without
		the overhead and complication of other modules then this is for you. Save, load, set, &amp; 
		get are very easy to grasp. The more advanced features are there for you to use,
		but don't get in the way. Settings, options, &amp; values can be listed, searched,
		detected, removed, &amp; cleared.
	</p>
	<p>
		Easy Settings uses a dictionary to store settings before writing to disk, so you can
		also access settings like a dictionary object using <code>easysettings.settings</code>. The
		<code>setsave()</code> function will save every time you set an option, and <code>is_saved()</code> will
		tell you whether or not the file has been saved to disk yet. Code is documented for a
		newbie, so a <code>help('EasySettings')</code> in the python console will get you started.
	</p>
	<p>
		The search_query argument in the list functions lets you find settings, options, and values by search string:
	</p>
	<pre class='python'>
mydebugoptions = settings.list_options('debug')
# clear all debug values..
settings.clear_values(mydebugoptions)
	</pre>
	<p>
	Non-string types were added, so any type that can be pickled can be used as an
	option's value. This includes all the major types like int, long, float, boolean, and list.
	All of these values will be retrieved as the same type that was set:
	</p>
	<pre class='python'>
es = easysettings.easysettings('myconfigfile.conf)
	
# Boolean
es.set("newuser", True)
if es.get('newuser'):
	print "now you can use get() as a boolean."

# Integer
es.set('maxwidth', 560)
halfwidth = es.get('maxwidth') / 2 # this math works.

# Float
es.set('soda', 1.59)
f_withtax = es.get('soda') * 1.08

# List
es.set('users', ['cjw', 'joseph', 'amy']) # lists as settings, very convenient
for suser in es.get('users'):
	print "retrieved user name: " + suser
	
# i won't do them all, but if you can pickle it, you can use it with easysettings.
	</pre>
	<p>
	You can setup an auto load of the whole easysettings instance using the
	new pickle features like this:
	</p>
	<pre class='python'>
from easysettings import easysettings
es = easysettings.easysettings().load_pickle('myconfigfile.pkl')
if es is None:
	# first time run, need to make an easysettings object.
	es = easysettings.easysettings() # uses default configfile if none is passed
	es.name = "My Project"
	es.version = "1.0"
	es.set("firstrun", False)
	es.save_pickle()
else:
	# pickle file was found, everything from the last save_pickle() was loaded.
	print "Loaded name, version, configfile, and all settings/options/values"
	
# now all you need to do is make sure to save_pickle() before your program exits,
# everything you set in easysettings will be retrieved next time.

# This is expirimental, and not really needed right now because you can pickle your
# own settings object without these functions. The functions are there for possible
# future purposes.
	</pre>
	<p>
		Errors are more descriptive and can be caught using their proper names:
	</p>
	<pre class='python'>
try:
	es.get('option_with_a_possibly_illegal_value')
except esGetError as exErr:
	print "Error getting option!"
except Exception as exEx:
	print "General Error!"
	</pre>

	<h2 class='title'>
		Automatic Creation
	</h2>

	<p>
		If you pass a file name to easysettings(), the <code>configfile_exists()</code> function is called. This
		function will create a blank config file if the file doesn't exist, otherwise it will return <code>True</code>.
		To use the 'automatic creation' do this:
	</p>
	<pre class='python'>
settings = easysettings.easysettings('myconfigfile.conf')
# if file exists, all settings were loaded.
# if file did not exist, it was created.
# No permissions, disk-full, and other errors are still possible of course
# depending on the machine, or the current directory permissions.
	</pre>
	<p>
		You can disable the 'automatic creation' features by not passing a file name, and loading seperately
		like this:
	</p>
	<pre class='python'>
settings = easysettings.easysettings()
settings.configfile = 'myconfigfile.conf'
# file has not been created or loaded. 
# file must exist before calling 'load_file'
if settings.load_file():
	# all settings were loaded.
else:
	# unable to load file for some reason.
	</pre>
	<p>
		This will work in the same way to disable the automatic creation:
	</p>
	<pre class='python'>
settings = easysettings.easysettings()
# file has not been created or loaded.
# file 'myconfigfile.conf' must exist before calling load_file()
if settings.load_file('myconfigfile.conf'):
	# file was loaded.
	# settings.configfile was set by the load_file() function
else:
	# file could not be loaded.
	</pre>
	<p>
		To check if the file exists without creating it automatically you can do this:
	</p>
	<pre class='python'>
if not settings.configfile_exists(False):
	print 'config file does not exist, and was not created.'
# I actually prefer the os.path.isfile() method if you're not going to automatically
# create the file.
import os.path
if not os.path.isfile(settings.configfile):
	print 'config file does not exist, and was not created.'
	</pre>
