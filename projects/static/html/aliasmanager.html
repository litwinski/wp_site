	<!-- Description -->
	<p>
	Manage your BASH aliases and functions using a GUI. Integrate one or more scripts into bashrc
	 with one click. <strong>Alias Manager</strong> will let you edit your scripts by listing all
	 aliases and functions in alphabetical order with a name, comment, command, and exported status.
	 After editing the comment and command, and if it's a function, you can select whether or not the
	 function is exported for global use, or not exported (for local script use). With integration
	 enabled <strong>Alias Manager</strong> adds one line to your bashrc that tells BASH to run the
	 <strong>Alias Manager</strong> helper script. This 'helper script' runs any script that you have
	 integrated with <strong>Alias Manager</strong> on BASH-startup. If no scripts are integrated
	 then the helper script does nothing, otherwise it will let you know which scripts were loaded on
	 BASH-startup.
