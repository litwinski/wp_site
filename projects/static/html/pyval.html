    <!-- Description -->
    Python evaluation bot for IRC. PyVal was made to evaluate python code
    safely (without compromising your own system), and depends on 
    [l]pypy-sandbox | http://pypy.org[?l]
    to block certain system calls. 
    <br><br>
    Within the PyVal directory, there is also a handy little tool called 
    'PyValExec', which is used by 'PyValBot', but can be used as a standalone 
    sandbox for testing purposes.
    <br>
    <br>
    The sandbox uses a 'fake' file system, that contains two directories:
    [bash]/bin[?bash] and [bash]/tmp[?bash]
    <br><br>
    The [bash]/tmp[?bash] directory contains a helper script called 
    [bash]pyval_sandbox.py[/bash] which by itself does not offer any security.
    It's main job is to take python code from [bash]stdin[/bash], and compile/run it.
    The security comes from running this 'helper script' inside the sandbox.
    <br><br>
    The [bash]/bin[?bash] directory contains several libraries/modules needed to
    run [l]pypy-sandbox | http://pypy.org[?l]
    <br><br>
    Read access is allowed in these two directories, but any [python]write()[/python]
    calls are automatically blocked. The sandbox allows you to [python]import[/python]
    many python modules, but will fail for certain 'critical' modules that are known
    to be insecure for sandbox purposes.

        The bot connects to [python]irc.freenode.net[/python].
        <br><br>
        Joins [bash]#pyval[/bash] on successful connection.
        <br>
        You can set the auto-join channels with the [bash]--channels[/bash] command-line option.
        <br><br>
        Nickname is set to <span class='I'>pyval</span>,
        which is registered to me so you will want to change that.
        <br>
        You can set the nick with the [bash]--nick[/bash] command-line option.
        <br><br>
        You are certainly free to take this code and start your own eval bot. 
        If you change the source in any way, please change the name from 
        <strong>PyVal</strong> / <strong>PyValBot</strong> to something else.
