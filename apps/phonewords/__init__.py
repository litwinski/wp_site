With PhoneWords the idea is you enter a phone number, and all possible
 number/letter combinations are checked against a word list to see if your
 number can be dialed using common words. For example, the number 426-2665
 could be dialed as 'iamcool', 'hambook', 'ibmbook', or just '426book'. There
 is also a 'reverse' lookup which is much simpler and faster. If you do a
 reverse lookup of 'hambook', the number 426-2665 will be quickly returned.
